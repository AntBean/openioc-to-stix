The files in this dir are examples of converting OpenIOC to STIX using the script.  

The *.ioc.xml files were obtained from the example files on http://www.openioc.org and are meant to show various indicators that can be found with OpenIOC.

Each *.ioc.xml file was converted using the openioc_to_stix.py and output to *.stix.xml.

For example: python openioc-to-stix.py -i ./examples/zeus.ioc.xml -o ./examples/zeus.stix.xml
